Recently, alien spacecraft sighting have been reported
all across the globe. Rather than vanish back into space,
as UFOs are known to do, they started landing and,
ostensibly, infiltrating the human population.

The acting President of the United States declared
that there is nothing to worry about, as aliens are just
Democrats' new hoax.

Meanwhile, NASA diverted some of its resources to
construct vehicles capable of stopping the alien threat.
Your first mission as NASA's most decorated Commander
Quill takes you to defend San Francisco.

Congratulations on successfully withstanding the alien
attack on the West Coast! But this is no time to celebrate,
for alien sightings have only increased.

The acting President of the United States issued a
statement asserting that the situation is under control.
Especially as the weather becomes warmer, the aliens
hopefully become weaker, and then gone.

Meanwhile, your next mission takes you to the other end of
the country, where New York has been identified as the next
major target.

third = """
Congratulations on successfully repealing the alien attack
on the East Coast! Unfortunately, the aliens are now
focusing on the administrative center of the country,
Washington DC. Some say they've been flying over the White
House in droves.

The acting President of the United States tweeted that he
always knew aliens were a serious threat. In fact, he
thought they were a serious threat before anyone called
them a serious threat.

Commander Quill, your final mission is to prevent the
alien command ship from descending upon the White House. 
"""

win = """
Hooray! You have succeeded in averting a catastrophe by
destroying the enemy command ship. And oh wow, the aliens
turned out to be Nazis - who could have guessed!

In recognition of your heroic effort, you are being
awarded the Medal of Honor. At the ceremony, the acting
President violently shakes your hand and keeps telling
the press how he personally recommended you for the job.

Final score: {}

fail = """
In spite of your valiant attempts, the aliens managed to
infiltrate the population. Unable to tell friend from foe,
the human race was slowly eradicated and farmed for juice.

The last chapter of the alien invasion was co-written by 
the now-former President of the United States. As Commander
Quill organized the remaining humans into a resistance
movement, the President secured his own survival by selling
out the resistance to the aliens.
